# FAQ
1. What is this?
Cooming stuff
2. Why did you do this?
Why not
3. How did you do this?

Do I look like I know how to do that?

# Issues
## I added one of your bundles and it broke XBVR! I can't go past that scene in the Web UI!
I probably screwed up the image links or left a quotation mark unescaped and just manually corrected it in main.db. Open an issue and tell me which scene it was and I'll fix it. Re-importing the bundle after that will unbork the Web UI.
## Can you add x, y, or z scene?
No
## But my JAVfu is in it...
**No**
